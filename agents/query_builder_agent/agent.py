"""Query-builder agent — orchestrates the 4-stage intake flow.

The model handles all reasoning per stage (see stages.py); this module owns the
state machine: it appends turns to history, advances stages when the model marks
one complete, auto-runs the next stage's opening (queries / competitors / final),
and assembles the final config.

Usable two ways:
  - Programmatically (the WebSocket router): `begin_session()` then `process_turn()`.
  - As a CLI chatbot: `python -m agents.query_builder_agent.agent`.
